## Introduction

Hi there, recently I have been facing a lot of issues with juncture. Since I want to be an expert in Ruby on Rails let's see the main functions. In my developper's life I have seen mainly three differents things for juncture as for now. (Note that this post can be updated and I'll add the other juncture I'll face in the future)

{% highlight ruby %}
def left_joins
def left_outer_joins
def joins
{% endhighlight %}

For the three methods, you can find their definitions in on [api.rubyonrails.org](https://api.rubyonrails.org/), [here](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/QueryMethods.html#method-i-joins), [here](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/QueryMethods.html#method-i-left_joins) and [here](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/QueryMethods.html#method-i-left_outer_joins).

`left_join` is simply an alias for the function `left_outer_joins` so we killed one. __2 Lefts__.

`left_outer_joins` is pretty simple, as the [doc say](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html#left-outer-joins) :
> If you want to select a set of records whether or not they have associated records you can use the left_outer_joins method.

As the function is called, this is an __OUTER_JOIN__ (🤦‍♂️ 😂). This is a short definition :
> External juncture to return all the records in the left table. Even if the condition is not verified in the other table.

Basically it means that an __OUTER JOIN__ will always return the values that have or not an associations.

The subtility with the __OUTER JOIN__ is that you'll probably endup with duplicates especially dealing with has_many association. For example you have a Delivery has_many Articles. Multiple Articles reference the same Delivery so you'll have duplicates.

__1 Lefts__.

The final one `joins` is an __INNER_JOIN__ juncture. What does that mean ?

> This command return the records when there are at least one line in each columns whom matches to the condition.

![inner-join](/assets/sql-inner-join.png "INNER JOIN")

If you understand the concept, there's no duplicate here, the query will return only the object that have an associations.
