After seeing the basic of Swift come the moment where you need to know some pattern. A design pattern, is a re-usable code that allow to solve common problem when designing an application. Today we'll see the Adapter pattern.

First of all, we won't see any UML schema, after seeing them all from other sites, it just confuse thing IMHO.
